#  Final assignment from Bill

In this paper, I will discuss about what I've learn and what I will do for my further study.


First, I would like to talk about my final assignment of ray tracing. I spent about a week and around 2 hours each day with the assignment, I've made all the step, from shading to reflection. Because this code really took me a long tome to run and get the output image, so I just got the image of teapot. And I've uploaded in this github link(I apologize for not knowiung how to put image in markdown file(the name of image is teapot.ppm)).


To be hnoest, without the help of Yiwen who is our TA, I couldn't successfully finish all the step. During step two, I firstly got the image like this (1.1.jpg), then i found out that I forget to normalize some of the vector and set up wrong limit of the loop.


When I was doing the reflection, I try to use recurrence and meet issues when setting up boarder of the resurrence, and meet segnment failt. With the help of TA, I finally understand how the code work and successfully get the right output image.


I've learn a lot during this project, this is my first time using C++ to do ray-tracing and stuff with images. I've learn coding for years but I don't know what these function could be used except solving questions during competition like USACO. I was in the stage of finding which part of compter science I'm really interested in. This project let me how ray-tracing work and the distance between me and professionals. I find out I still need to work hard to reach my dream. During the first assignment, I almost done all the part with little TA help, but I almost take me 10 hours on reviewing and trying to transfer formula to code, but for some other students, this assignment only take them a few minutes or less than a hour, I clearly know that I still need to do more on writing code and learning knowledge about computer graphic.


In the future, I would like to attend course in other part of computer science if possible and find my ideal major in university. And for ray-tracing, I will still work hard becuase when I was small, one of my dream is engaging in producing game or movies as backstage crew or tech supportor.
